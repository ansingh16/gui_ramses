This repository contains an attempt to make a GUI based analysis utility for RAMSES simulation. 
The currently just produces a nml file that can be generated by filling up boxes in GUI. 
Idea is to use integrate the [yt-project](https://yt-project.org/) analysis package for visualization and analysis. This is an incomplete project please use carefully.
